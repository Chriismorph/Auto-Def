# Robloxer
I've made this script for educational but not personal use. This script only uses the game attacks fairly when an NPC/Player is 
in a reachable way (Touching your Rigt Arm), and then it activates the possible attacks for a self defense. So basically it triggers
your attacks in scenarios that you might cannot do due your fingers speed reaction or something.

> **Warning:** Use this at your own risk. As you might get BANNED from roblox if you use
> EXPLOITS. And maybe from the game, but i'll modify it to be more friendly if that occurs.
