# ABOUT
Robloxer is a script for Roblox that enhances your gameplay experience without modifying in-game sources. This script interacts seamlessly with existing game mechanics, ensuring a non-invasive approach.
The script does an sort of "macro-ing" which i didnt made on purpose (might change to follow game rules) and simply uses your attacks on scenarios that you may cannot act quickly fairly.

This script is intended for educational and personal use. Always respect Roblox’s Terms of Service and game developer’ rules. 
Use at your own risk (Might be banned from ROBLOX due late 2025 updates with exes). And you MIGHT lose skills if you use this constantly.

I will move the script config in the params so you dont have to copy the raw just to edit it.

- for sarkrinth if he ever reads this!!1!!
