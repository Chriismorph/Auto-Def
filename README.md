# Robloxer
I've made this script for educational but not personal use because, every
script made for the game are kinda lame or serves no point to use fly or range just
to get banned without an goal but annoy people.

> [!WARNING]  
> Use this at your own risk. As you might get BANNED from roblox if you use
> EXPLOITS. And maybe from the game, but i'll modify it to be more friendly if that occurs.

> [!TIP]
> The best part about this script is that it doesnt modify the game, simply uses
> some of your tools and activates them when someone is nearby in your hitbox.
> The only "evil" part of this script is the fact it does an sort of macro. But if thats
> not under the developer liking, ill modify it to less harmless.


- for sarkrinth if he ever reads this!!1!!
