Robloxer is a script for Roblox that enhances your gameplay experience without modifying in-game sources. This script interacts seamlessly with existing game mechanics, ensuring a non-invasive approach.
To run the script, use the following Lua code in a Roblox environment (e.g., via an executor):

```lua
local Params = {
	RepoURL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chriismorph/Robloxer/refs/heads/main/",
	SSI = "main"
}

loadstring(game:HttpGet(Params.RepoURL .. Params.SSI .. ".lua", true), Params.SSI)()
```

"Feel free to fork this repository"

This script is intended for educational and personal use. Always respect Roblox’s Terms of Service and game developers’ rules. 
This script while has an "macro" it wasnt really intended to be done.
Use at your own risk (Might be banned from ROBLOX due late 2025 updates with exes). And you MIGHT lose skills if you use this constantly.
